Let's go do SearchParams.tsx

```tsx
// update React import, add Reach Router import
import { FunctionComponent, useState, useEffect, useContext } from "react";
import { RouteComponentProps } from "@reach/router";
import { PetAPIResponse, Animal, Pet } from "./APIResponsesTypes";

const ANIMALS: Animal[] = ["bird", "cat", "dog", "rabbit", "reptile"];

// replace function declaration
const SearchParams: FunctionComponent<RouteComponentProps> = () => {
  ‚Ä¶
}

// replace useState calls
const [animal, updateAnimal] = useState("" as Animal);
const [pets, setPets] = useState([] as Pet[]);

// add void to effect
void requestPets();

// in PetRequest
const json = (await res.json()) as PetAPIResponse;

//
<select
  id="animal"
  value={animal}
  onChange={(e) => updateAnimal(e.target.value as Animal)}
  onBlur={(e) => updateAnimal(e.target.value as Animal)}
>
  { ‚Ä¶ }
</select>
```

- Occasionally you need to give TypeScript a hint to what it's going to get. That's what `as` for: you're saying I'm sure it's going to be this.
- We have to let React know what sort of parameters this component expects. And in this case it's a React Router route so it expects a path so we need let TypeScript in on the secret. This actually isn't required here but we do know that it will be a route component so might as well be explicit. It makes it easier to come back later.
- We didn't have to add all the Animal typings but since we know it's that we may as well.
